    "\n",
    "### When to use `async def`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Third party library supports await\n",
    "@app.get('/')\n",
    "async def read_results():\n",
    "    results = await some_library()\n",
    "    return results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use regular `def`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Third party library does NOT support await (most database libraries)\n",
    "@app.get('/')\n",
    "def results():\n",
    "    results = some_library()\n",
    "    return results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `async def`** if you need to use `await` inside\n",
    "- **Use `def`** if you're calling synchronous libraries\n",
    "- **When in doubt**, use regular `def`\n",
    "- You can **mix both** in the same app - FastAPI handles both correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** You can only use `await` inside functions created with `async def`"

    "## Part 1: Fundamental Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Async Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous code** means the language has a way to tell the program that at some point, it will have to **wait for something else** to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "During that waiting time, the program can go do **other work** instead of just blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I/O Bound Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"waiting\" typically refers to **I/O operations** (relatively slow compared to CPU/RAM):\n",
    "- Network requests (HTTP calls, database queries)\n",
    "- File system operations (reading/writing files)\n",
    "- User input\n",
    "- Remote API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called **\"I/O bound\"** operations because execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for I/O."

    "## Summary: Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fundamentals:\n",
    "1. **Calling `async def` creates a coroutine** - it doesn't run the code\n",
    "2. **Coroutines must be scheduled** via `await`, `create_task()`, or `asyncio.run()`\n",
    "3. **`await` yields control** to the event loop during I/O waits\n",
    "4. **Without `await` inside**, no yielding happens even if the function is `async def`\n",
    "\n",
    "### For FastAPI:\n",
    "1. **Use `async def`** when calling libraries that support `await`\n",
    "2. **Use `def`** when calling synchronous libraries (most databases)\n",
    "3. **Mix freely** - FastAPI handles both correctly\n",
    "4. **When in doubt** - use `def`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance:\n",
    "1. **Async shines** for I/O-bound operations (web apps)\n",
    "2. **Concurrency ≠ Parallelism** - understand the difference\n",
    "3. **Use `create_task()`** for concurrent I/O operations\n",
    "4. **CPU-bound work** needs executors or multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes:\n",
    "1. ❌ Using `time.sleep()` instead of `await asyncio.sleep()`\n",
    "2. ❌ Forgetting to `await` async functions\n",
    "3. ❌ Using sync libraries (requests) in async code\n",
    "4. ❌ Wrapping sync code in `async def` without `await`\n",
